Does anyone here have experience contributing to an open-source project? I’ve never done it before, but I really want to get involved. Could anyone advise me on how to start? We can connect via LinkedIn to discuss the details later.

video on using transformers in science, to brainstorm events/possibilities, good if there is a way to independently test accuracy

Hi, thanks for having me in this lovely group. I am an academic trying to get into an industry role. I have degrees in Math and information systems. I'm good with ML and stat concepts, my Python and SQL skill level is intermediate, and have done some personal projects using NLP and LLm.

@Ismael Reyes, Yes, the github repo of the book has a very detailed installation guide, for all kinds of use cases and gpu/cpu local.

For setup, generally uses Python v 3.10- or v 3.11 and PyTorch v 2.4.0.  Also make sure you don't use Numpy 2.0, latest is v 1.26.4

thanks again. I'll have to check my versions. I've not used Pytorch before
Ismael Reyes

does this make sense? "Exception: You tried to install "pytorch". The package named for PyTorch is "torch""
aren't torch and pytorch two different animals?
Anthony B
7:20 PM
no
PyTorch is just a reference to Python Torch, where Python is the language and Torch being teh module
I agree it is confusing
Ismael Reyes
7:20 PM
so pip install torch and not pip install pytorch?
Anthony B
7:21 PM
yes
